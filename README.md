This respository contains a set of programming assignments done as part of the Machine Learning course conducted by Andrew NG on Coursera. The assignments were done in MATLAB and support files for each assignment were provided as part of the course. The PDFs in each assignment folder detail which files were completed by me and which files were provided as part of the course.
The topics covered in the assignments include:
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Multi-Class Classification
4. Neural Networks Learning
5. Learning Curves
6. Support Vector Machines
7. K-means Clustering & Principal Component Analysis
8. Recommender Systems & Anomaly Detection

If you are doing the course, then please do not refer to the solutions before the week deadlines as per the Stanford Honor Code: "We strongly encourage students to form study groups, and discuss the lecture videos (including in-video questions). We also encourage you to get together with friends to watch the videos together as a group. However, the answers that you submit for the review questions should be your own work. For the programming exercises, you are welcome to discuss them with other students, discuss specific algorithms, properties of algorithms, etc.; we ask only that you not look at any source code written by a different student, nor show your solution code to other students."
